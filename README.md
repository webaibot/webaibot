### `>about`

**WebAI** is an AI-powered platform that generates fully functional bots from a simple text prompt.  
Describe what you want — a game, an assistant, a tool — and get production-ready source code in seconds.

Every bot is deployed directly to this GitHub account. Browse, clone, and run any of them.

### `>cortex`

All bots are powered by **[CORTEX](https://github.com/webaibot/cortex)** — our custom AI engine built from scratch.

```
CORTEX — Custom Orchestrated Response & Text Engine eXtended

├── 6-pass compiler         Lexical → Semantic → Structural → Neural → Synthesis → Optimize
├── Neural Mesh Network     Multi-head attention with adaptive weight routing
├── Knowledge Graph         Triple-store with BFS traversal & cosine similarity
├── NLP Pipeline            TF-IDF intent classification, pattern-based NER, sentiment analysis
├── FSM Builder             Finite state machines for complex conversation flows
├── Code Generator          AST-based compiler, scaffolder, dead-code optimizer
├── Plugin System           Auto-discovery, hot-reload, sandboxed execution
└── REST API + CLI          Full server and command-line interface
```

CORTEX processes every prompt through its multi-stage pipeline — from natural language understanding to code generation — without relying on any third-party AI APIs. The entire architecture is open-source and self-contained.

> `>` Zero external dependencies. Pure custom intelligence.

### `>stack`

```
platform    → Next.js + React + Tailwind
engine      → CORTEX v1.0 (Python)
bots        → Python / Flask + HTML/CSS/JS
deployment  → GitHub API (auto-push)
infra       → Docker + docker-compose
```

---

### `>how_it_works`

```
1. describe    →  user writes a prompt: "blackjack game bot"
2. compile     →  CORTEX 6-pass compiler processes the request
3. generate    →  full project scaffolded: app.py, templates, configs, Dockerfile
4. deploy      →  code is pushed to github.com/webaibot/<bot-name>
5. run         →  clone it, docker-compose up, done
```
